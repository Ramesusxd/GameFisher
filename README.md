# GameFisher
A Program I made in java that lets a user select the game(file) they want to work on and moves the install file to the desktop. 
**NOTE** this program will not work unless you reassign the folder in the source code. I made this tool to make a task a bit easier at work. and wont work as is unless you are
on a computer in my office at work. the program just points to a specific folder that is only on work computers with my employer. just reassign this code "\\\\lvstore\\builds\\Title\\QA\\Titles"
on lines 23, 56, 67, and 78. to the folder of your choice on your PC
